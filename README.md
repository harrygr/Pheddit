# Linklet

Linklet is a simple Reddit/HackerNews clone. It uses Elixir/[Phoenix][1] for the
backend and React/Redux in TypeScript for the frontend.

Requirements:

* Elixir/Erlang
* MySQL
* Node/NPM

To run locally:

* Enter your database credentials in `config/dev.exs` or export the appropriate
  env variables
* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get` and `cd frontend; yarn install`/`npm
  install`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
* Start the Phoenix server. This will serve the build frontend files as well as
  provide the api.

  ```
  mix phoenix.server
  ```

* Start the frontend dev server. This serves the frontend using the webpack
  server so you get live reload.

  ```
  cd frontend
  yarn start
  ```

Now you can visit [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) from your browser.
The Phoenix server runs on [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000)

There is a live deployment at (http://linklet.surge.sh)[http://linklet.surge.sh]
